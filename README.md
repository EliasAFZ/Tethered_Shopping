# Tethered_Shopping

## Grocery shopping probelm 
You are given a list of items (file) to retrieve and the layout of the store (2d-Array boolean locations of items). 
This code shows the shortest path to retrieve each item in the store with two algorithms one where you are untethered (shopping cart free to move whichever direction in this case forward or reverse ) and the other where you tethered. (think of a vacumn with a cable starting at the beginning of an aisle)
